# level-zero
Geek and Goth: Level Zero BETA (Video Game)

Yes I'm a noob and this is my first attempt programming a real world project and its my first time trying to build a website... so almost everything is a learning exprience for me, including using git-hub... so hopefully nobody will hate me too much if I'm doing some things wrong... but I sure won't complain about any help or advice I can get. I want to improve my skills and learn from my peirs and I want to provide the best user experience possible.

I will update this again once I have finished staging files and assure they work.
